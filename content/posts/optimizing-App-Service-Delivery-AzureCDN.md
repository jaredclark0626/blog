Optimizing App Service using Azure CDN 

In this short blog we will talk about optimizing the content delivery to an App Service using Azure Content Delivery Network. This will help us delivery updated versions of our code to Azure CDN to different regions around the world. Instead of delivering our code to a specific region in Azure we will distribute our code to multiple regions in Azure using Azure CDN. This allows users from all over the world to quickly access our App.
